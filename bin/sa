[1mNAME[0m
       [1mrofi dmenu mode [22m- Rofi dmenu emulation

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       To  integrate  [1mrofi [22minto scripts as simple selection dialogs, [1mrofi [22msupports emulating [1mdmenu(1) [22m(A dynamic menu
       for X11).

       The website for [1mdmenu [22mcan be found here ⟨http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/⟩.

       [1mrofi [22mdoes not aim to be 100% compatible with [1mdmenu[22m. There are simply too many flavors of [1mdmenu[22m.  The  idea  is
       that  the  basic  usage command-line flags are obeyed, theme-related flags are not.  Besides, [1mrofi [22moffers some
       extended features (like multi-select, highlighting, message bar, extra key bindings).

[1mBASIC CONCEPT[0m
       In [1mdmenu [22mmode, [1mrofi [22mreads data from standard in, splits them into separate entries and displays them.  If  the
       user selects an row, this is printed out to standard out, allow the script to process it further.

       By  default  separation of rows is done on new lines, making it easy to pipe the output a one application into
       [1mrofi [22mand the output of rofi into the next.

[1mUSAGE[0m
       By launching [1mrofi [22mwith the [1m-dmenu [22mflag it will go into dmenu emulation mode.

              ls | rofi -dmenu

   [1mDMENU DROP-IN REPLACEMENT[0m
       If [1margv[0] [22m(calling command) is dmenu, [1mrofi [22mwill start in dmenu mode.  This way, it can be used as  a  drop-in
       replacement for dmenu. Just copy or symlink [1mrofi [22mto dmenu in [1m$PATH[22m.

              ln -s /usr/bin/rofi /usr/bin/dmenu

   [1mDMENU VS SCRIPT MODE[0m
       Script  mode is used to extend [1mrofi[22m, dmenu mode is used to extend a script.  The two do share much of the same
       input format. Please see the [1mrofi-script(5) [22mmanpage for more information.

   [1mDMENU SPECIFIC COMMANDLINE FLAGS[0m
       A lot of these options can also be modified by the script using special input. See the [1mrofi-script(5)  [22mmanpage
       for more information about this syntax.

       [1m-sep [4m[22mseparator[0m

       Separator for [1mdmenu[22m. Example: To show a list of 'a' to 'e' with '|' as a separator:

              echo "a|b|c|d|e" | rofi -sep '|' -dmenu

       [1m-p [4m[22mprompt[0m

       Specify the prompt to show in [1mdmenu [22mmode. For example, select 'monkey', a,b,c,d, or e.

              echo "a|b|c|d|e" | rofi -sep '|' -dmenu -p "monkey"

       Default: [4mdmenu[0m

       [1m-l [4m[22mnumber[24m [4mof[24m [4mlines[24m [4mto[24m [4mshow[0m

       Active  row,  mark  [4mX[24m as active. Where [4mX[24m is a comma-separated list of python(1)-style indices and ranges, e.g.
       indices start at 0, -1 refers to the last row with -2 preceding it, ranges are left-open and right-close,  and
       so on. You can specify:

              • A single row: '5'

              • A range of (last 3) rows: '-3:'

              • 4 rows starting from row 7: '7:11' (or in legacy notation: '7-10')

              • A set of rows: '2,0,-9'

              • Or any combination: '5,-3:,7:11,2,0,-9'

       [1m-u [4m[22mX[0m

       Urgent row, mark [4mX[24m as urgent. See [1m-a [22moption for details.

       [1m-only-match[0m

       Only return a selected item, do not allow custom entry.  This mode always returns an entry. It will not return
       if no matching entry is selected.

       [1m-no-custom[0m

              • 's' selected string

              • 'i' index (0 - (N-1))

              • 'd' index (1 - N)

              • 'q' quote string

              • 'p' Selected string stripped from Pango markup (Needs to be a valid string)

              • 'f' filter string (user input)

              • 'F' quoted filter string (user input)

       Default: 's'

       Dump the filtered list to stdout and quit.  This can be used to get the list as [1mrofi [22mwould filter it.  Use to‐
       gether with [1m-filter [22mcommand.

       [1m-input [4m[22mfile[0m

       Reads from [4mfile[24m instead of stdin.

       [1m-password[0m

       Hide the input text. This should not be considered secure!

       [1m-markup-rows[0m

       Tell [1mrofi [22mthat DMenu input is Pango  markup  encoded,  and  should  be  rendered.   See  here  ⟨https://devel‐
       oper.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/pango-markup-language.html⟩ for details about Pango markup.

       [1m-multi-select[0m

       as [1m-dump[22m, [1m-only-match [22mor [1m-auto-select[22m.
